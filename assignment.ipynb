        "  5. Use the `PolynomialFeatures` function from `sklearn` to expand the set of numerical variables you're using in the regression. As you increase the degree of the expansion, how do the $R^2$ and `RMSE` change? At what point does $R^2$ go negative on the test set? For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 4?\n",

Do the predicted values and true values roughly line up along the diagonal, or not? Compute the residuals/errors for the test data and create a kernel density plot. Do the residuals look roughly bell-shaped around zero? Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of your model."

        "**Q3.** This is a question about linear regression. The outcome is whether a defendant is held pre-trial in the Virginia justice system. We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",
